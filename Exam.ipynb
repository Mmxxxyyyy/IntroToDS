    "\n",
    "## Instructions:\n",
    "1. Complete the problems by following instructions.\n",
    "2. When done, submit this file with your solutions saved, following the instruction sheet.\n",
    "\n",
    "This exam has 3 problems for a total of 40 points, to pass you need\n",
    "20 points. The bonus will be added to the score of the exam and rounded afterwards.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Some general hints and information:\n",
    "* Try to answer all questions even if you are uncertain.\n",
    "* Comment your code, so that if you get the wrong answer I can understand how you thought\n",
    "this can give you some points even though the code does not run.\n",
    "* Follow the instruction sheet rigorously.\n",
    "* This exam is partially autograded, but your code and your free text answers are manually graded anonymously.\n",
    "* If there are any questions, please ask the exam guards, they will escalate it to me if necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tips for free text answers\n",
    "* Be VERY clear with your reasoning, there should be zero ambiguity in what you are referring to.\n",
    "* If you want to include math, you can write LaTeX in the Markdown cells, for instance `$f(x)=x^2$` will be rendered as $f(x)=x^2$ and `$$f(x) = x^2$$` will become an equation line, as follows\n",
    "$$f(x) = x^2$$\n",
    "Another example is `$$f_{Y \\mid X}(y,x) = P(Y = y \\mid X = x) = \\exp(\\alpha \\cdot x + \\beta)$$` which renders as\n",
    "$$f_{Y \\mid X}(y,x) = P(Y = y \\mid X = x) = \\exp(\\alpha \\cdot x + \\beta)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Finally some rules:\n",
    "* You may not communicate with others during the exam, for example:\n",
    "    * You cannot ask for help in Stack-Overflow or other such help forums during the Exam.\n",
    "    * You may not communicate with AI's, for instance ChatGPT.\n",
    "    * Your on-line and off-line activity is being monitored according to the examination rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Good luck!"
